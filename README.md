# Cyclistic Bike Usage Analysis: Annual Members vs. Casual Riders

## Overview

This project analyzes bike usage patterns of annual members and casual riders for Cyclistic, a fictional bike-sharing company. The study aims to provide data-driven insights to enhance member retention and conversion strategies.

## Project Objectives

- **Primary Question**: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
- **Goal**: Utilize data-driven insights to inform strategic decisions for improving user engagement and conversion rates.

## Data Preparation

- **Data Sources**: Cyclistic ride data from 2019 to 2020.
- **Storage & Organization**: Data stored on Office 365, organized by year and month.
- **Cleaning Process**: Addressed duplicates, removed negative values, and ensured consistent column names.

## Data Processing

- **Tools Used**: Excel and R for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Key Transformations**: Added `ride_length` and `day_of_week` columns, handled missing values.
- **Data Integrity**: Verified and documented the cleaning and transformation processes to ensure accurate analysis.

## Analysis Overview

- **Aggregation**: Data was aggregated for easier analysis.
- **Key Metrics**: Calculated mean, median, minimum, and maximum ride lengths.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compared usage patterns between casual riders and annual members, focusing on ride frequency and duration.

## Key Findings

- **Ride Duration**: Casual riders have longer average ride durations compared to annual members.
- **Frequency**: Annual members consistently make more trips throughout the week.
